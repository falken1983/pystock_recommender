# pystock_recommender
`pystock_recommender` learns to rank stocks from passive replicas of the main Global Equity Indices (namely ETFs) and eventually improve
cumulative returns trying to target a similar annual volatility with regard to the index (ETF replica) benchmark product.

Other financial Risk and/or Performance Measures (**PMs**, for short) are planned to be benchmarked.

Simple Trading Rules are inferred from Learners in order to outperform passive investments strategies.

These rankers are directly based on supervised Learning-To-Rank (**LTR** from now on) algorithms.

**LTR** were mainly developed in other Deep and Machine Learning typical scopes such as web search engines and others.
Advanced features construction is also planned to be considered.
