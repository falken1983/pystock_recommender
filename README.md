# pystock_recommender
`pystock_recommender` learns to rank stocks from passive replicas (namely ETFs) of the main Global Equity Indices and eventually improve
cumulative returns trying to target a similar annual volatility.

Other financial Risk and Performance Measures (**RPMs**, for short) are planned to be benchmarked (compared).
Moreover advanced _features construction and selection_ based on **RPMs** will be considered.

Simple Trading Rules are inferred from Learners in order to outperform passive investments strategies.

These rankers are directly based on supervised Learning-To-Rank (**LTR** from now on) Algos.

**LTR** were mainly developed for other Deep and Machine Learning archetypical scopes such as web search engines.
